# Django
- Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites and web applications. It follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, emphasizing reusability and efficiency. Django provides built-in features for handling tasks such as URL routing, database modeling, authentication, and templating, making it popular among developers for its simplicity and scalability.



## Some key features of Django include:

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Django provides a powerful ORM that allows you to interact with your database using Python objects, abstracting away the need to write SQL queries directly.

Admin Interface: Django automatically generates an admin interface for managing your application's data. This interface is customizable and provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality out of the box.

URL Routing: Django's URL dispatcher lets you map URLs to view functions, making it easy to organize and manage your application's URLs.

Template System: Django's template engine allows you to build dynamic HTML templates, separating the presentation layer from the business logic.

Security: Django includes built-in protections against common web security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and clickjacking.

Scalability: Django is designed to scale easily, allowing you to handle high traffic loads by employing techniques such as caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling.
